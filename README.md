      "gog": "1423049311"
    },
    "bin": [
      "Cyberpunk2077.exe"
    ]
  },

    "name": "LEGOÂ® Jurassic World",
    "id": {
      "steam": "352400"
    },

      "LEGOJurassicWorld.exe",
      "LEGOJurassicWorld_DX11.exe"
    ]
  }
]
```

Notice
======
 
- A game has a corresponding platform id **only** if it has achievements on said platform. Yes, they are games that are available on multiple platforms but have achievements only on one.
- "Uplay ID" is an **array** because uplay games aren't unique in the sense that they can have multiple ids based on ~~whatever~~ various reasons (regions, ...).
- When a game uses a launcher for its executable(s), adding the launcher's binary to the game binaries _should_ only be allowed if the launcher stays hooked to the game's executable(s).
